# Rigorous AI-Powered Scientific Manuscript Analysis

> **v0.2 Now Live:** The latest version of the AI Reviewer (v0.2) is now available at [https://www.rigorous.review/](https://www.rigorous.review/). Upload your manuscript, provide context on your target journal and review goals, and receive structured feedback directly online via an interactive interface — now with progress tracking built in. Once initial testing of v0.2 is complete, we will make all module prompts open source to promote transparency and enable community contributions.

> **Help Us Improve!** Please provide feedback via [this short feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EhQvw-HdGRqfL01jZaayoaiTWLSydZTI4V0lJSvNpds) to help us improve the system.

## Vision

This repository is intended for tools that make the creation, evaluation, and distribution of scientific knowledge more transparent, cheaper, faster, and better. Let's build this future together!

## Project Structure

- **Agent1_Peer_Review**: Multiagent AI review system for comprehensive manuscript analysis, detailed feedback, and PDF report generation.
- **Agent2_Outlet_Fit**: (In Development) Tool for evaluating manuscript fit with target journals/conferences.

## Current Status

### Active Tools
- **Agent1_Peer_Review**: ✅ MVP Ready for use!
  - Comprehensive manuscript analysis with specialized agents
  - Detailed feedback on sections, scientific rigor, and writing quality (including quality control loops)
  - JSON output with actionable recommendations
  - PDF report generation
  - [📄 Detailed Documentation and Key Areas for Contribution](https://github.com/robertjakob/rigorous/blob/main/Agent1_Peer_Review/README.md)

### In Development
- **Agent2_Outlet_Fit**: 🚧 In Development
  - Core functionality being implemented
  - Integration with Agent1_Peer_Review in progress
  - Testing and validation ongoing
  - [🛠️ Development Plan](https://github.com/robertjakob/rigorous/blob/main/Agent2_Outlet_Fit/README.md)

### Future Modules and Ideas
- **Embedding-based similarity analysis** (by [@andjar](https://github.com/andjar)): Use embeddings (as in [*The landscape of biomedical research*](https://github.com/berenslab/pubmed-landscape)) to compare a paper’s abstract with existing literature. This could help surface uncited but relevant work and suggest suitable journals based on similarity clusters.
- Support for Drafting Reviewer Reponses.
- Feedback on Research Proposals and Protocols.
- AI-enabled document creation tool ("Cursor for Papers").
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key (the system can be adapted to alternative LLMs, including locally hosted ones)
- PDF manuscripts to analyze
- Dependencies listed in each tool's requirements.txt
